    "To what extent does the presence of a professional sports stadium act as a localized economic catalyst compared to broader metropolitan trends?

    "Professional sports stadiums are often significantly large venues that host often profitable sporting events for the NFL, NBA, NHL, and other sporting leagues. Stadiums are also culturally significant as events like the Super Bowl, hosted in the Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana in 2025, had around 120 million viewers and around 76,000 filled seats.It can be assumed that stadiums  stimulate economic activity around the local area as businesses take advantage of the large foot traffic stadiums create, creating more jobs, increasing spending, tourism, and property value <sup>[2](#https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46552225_How_Does_a_New_Sports_Stadium_Affect_Housing_Values_The_Case_of_Fedex_Field)</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, studies and articles conclude that the construction of new stadiums yields negligible improvements to local employment<sup>[3](#https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22534)</sup>, and may take spending away from local businesses as people spend it on stadium related costs instead. Additionally, stadium construction is often funded by public subsidies that can be used on other local construction projects or programs. While stadiums may generate a localized economic surge within their immediate vicinity<sup>[1](#https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/NAR.2024024?viewType=HTML)</sup> and foster civic identity and pride, analysts argue their regional economic impact is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we are observing how professional sports stadiums affect the local economy. In a 2024 research paper, Antolini Valerio analyzes trends in GDP per capita in Turin, Italy around the construction of a new and technologically impressive NFL stadium called a next-generation stadium. The writer found a causal relationship between an increase in GDP per capita with the new stadium compared to other regions of Italy that showed comparatively lower growths in GDP per capita1. The paper provides some insights on how new and expensive stadiums can change local economic production. In a study by Charles Tu, the construction of a stadium causes homes to be sold at a lower price, but over longer periods of time land value increases. The study shows that there are changes to local property values which will be examined and compared in our own data. The paper by Bradbury and co, details the large public costs of newly constructed professional sports stadiums compared to how little economic improvement they provide. This review on the stadiums and their impacts show the confounding ethical, public, and economic variables that we need to interpret to understand how professional sports stadiums impact localized economies.\n",

    "We predict that the presence of a professional sports stadium  will cause overall economic growth, specifically through an increase in total businesses and employment rates for the neighborhoods within a 2-mile radius of a stadium when compared to other neighborhoods within the same city, however this growth will be inversely correlated with property values in the same area. We predict that median housing prices within the 2 mile radius will grow at a lower rate than the city-wide average due to negative externalities from the stadium like pollution due to smog, construction, energy consumption, traffic congestion, and noise, all of which can have a stronger negative effect on property values more than the positive externalities from the stadium such as the business growth and infrastructure improvements. Neighborhoods a few miles away will see higher housing prices as people would want to live within range of the stadium to enjoy events, but also out of range to avoid the negative effects. "

    "  - Description of the variables most relevant to this project: This project's most relevant variables are the percentage of people below the poverty level, class of worker, industry, income, and employment status, because these will tell us whether areas closer to stadiums correlate to  a higher or lower unemployment rate, as well as the poverty level and average income. \n",
    "  - Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with repsect to the project:\n",
    "  One of the biggest shortcomings from the dataset is the amount of time it goes back, because it doesn't allow for us to view the historic data from before stadiums were built to see if there was a net positive gain for the community from the stadium or not. Another Shortcoming that could hinder our data analysis is the presence of county subdivisions. Larger states and cities maye have more subdivisions of counties than other places, which can lead to differences in geographical distance to a stadium within a county, and since there is no standardized map correlated to stadiums, there can be an issue when calculating data using subdivisions of counties.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All of our data is from the US Census and a Kaggle Dataset of Stadium locations. This means it is all collected through the informed consent of the individuals and public geographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Census Data can be biased, and certain individuals can sometimes fail to report sometimes. To mitigate this, we are taking our data over a course of 10+ years to judge median incomes and percentage increase, rather than raw income increases. This ensures that the bias will be mitigated due to differences in economic parity between cities and neighborhoods\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    ">This project minimizes exposure to personally identifiable information (PII) by exclusively using public, aggregated datasets that do not contain individual level records. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    ">Downstream bias is addressed by using aggregated Census demographic variables (e.g., race composition, housing tenure, income distribution) to examine whether observed neighborhood-level outcomes differ across demographic contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Since all datasets are public and non-PII, risk is minimal; nonetheless, standard safeguards such as access control and versioned backups are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Because the project uses only publicly available, aggregated data with no personal identifiers, individual data removal requests are not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Data will be retained only for the duration of the project and any required academic review period, after which local copies will be deleted. Public sources can be re-downloaded if replication is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We acknowledge that quantitative data may not capture lived experiences such as cultural displacement or housing insecurity. To address this, findings are contextualized using urban economics literature and prior case studies of stadium-led development, and assumptions are explicitly stated.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We explicitly examine known biases, including undercounting, survivorship bias due to displacement, and temporal smoothing in ACS data. We mitigate these through difference-in-differences analysis, sensitivity checks, and comparisons with control neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Visualizations and summary statistics are designed to avoid misleading interpretations. We present confidence intervals, margins of error where applicable, and avoid framing aggregate improvements as universal benefits without qualification.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    ">No PII is used or displayed in analysis outputs. All results are reported at an aggregated geographic level.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    ">The analysis workflow is fully documented and reproducible. Code, data sources, assumptions, and preprocessing steps are clearly recorded to enable auditing or revision if issues are discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    ">The project does not involve predictive models that make decisions about individuals. Demographic variables are used analytically to detect inequitable outcomes, not to allocate resources or make judgments about individuals or groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We explicitly compare outcomes across demographic subgroups (e.g., renter-heavy vs owner-heavy tracts) to assess whether stadium proximity is associated with uneven economic effects.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We avoid relying on a single metric (e.g., median income) and instead evaluate multiple indicators such as rent burden, housing values, employment, and business activity to reduce metric-induced bias.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - \n",
    ">All analytical methods (e.g., difference-in-differences) are explained in plain language, and results are interpretable without requiring advanced statistical background.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We clearly communicate limitations, including data bias, inability to observe displaced residents directly, and the non-causal nature of some findings. Conclusions are framed cautiously to avoid overgeneralization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">This project is an academic analysis and does not involve a deployed system or model requiring ongoing monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">As no automated decisions or services are deployed, formal redress mechanisms are not applicable. However, findings are presented responsibly to avoid harm through misinterpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    ">No production system or model is deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We acknowledge the risk that findings could be misused to justify harmful development practices. To mitigate this, results are contextualized ethically, emphasizing distributional impacts rather than framing stadium development as inherently beneficial or harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally:\n",
    "\n",
    "Longtime residents of these areas can be priced out of their homes and neighborhoods, especially as the price of housing increases, leading to gentrification around the stadium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stadiums can bring seasonal work, but not permanent employment, causing the surrounding area to see greater short term economic growth but realistically this employment structure is unstable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stadiums can affect the local environment, causing more pollution due to construction, traffic, energy consumption, etc. This pollution leads to the decreased quality of life around a stadium, causing people to move further away to still enjoy benefits without the drawbacks."
