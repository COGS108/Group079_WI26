    "Professional sports stadiums are often significantly large venues that host often profitable sporting events for the NFL, NBA, NHL, and other sporting leagues. Stadiums are also culturally significant as events like the Super Bowl, hosted in the Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana in 2025, had around 120 million viewers and around 76,000 filled seats.It can be assumed that stadiums  stimulate economic activity around the local area as businesses take advantage of the large foot traffic stadiums create, creating more jobs, increasing spending, tourism, and property value <sup>[2](#https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46552225_How_Does_a_New_Sports_Stadium_Affect_Housing_Values_The_Case_of_Fedex_Field)</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, studies and articles conclude that the construction of new stadiums yields negligible improvements to local employment<sup>[3](#https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22534)</sup>, and may take spending away from local businesses as people spend it on stadium related costs instead. Additionally, stadium construction is often funded by public subsidies that can be used on other local construction projects or programs. While stadiums may generate a localized economic surge within their immediate vicinity<sup>[1](#https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/NAR.2024024?viewType=HTML)</sup> and foster civic identity and pride, analysts argue their regional economic impact is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we are observing how professional sports stadiums affect the local economy. In a 2024 research paper, Antolini Valerio analyzes trends in GDP per capita in Turin, Italy around the construction of a new and technologically impressive NFL stadium called a next-generation stadium. The writer found a causal relationship between an increase in GDP per capita with the new stadium compared to other regions of Italy that showed comparatively lower growths in GDP per capita1. The paper provides some insights on how new and expensive stadiums can change local economic production. In a study by Charles Tu, the construction of a stadium causes homes to be sold at a lower price, but over longer periods of time land value increases. The study shows that there are changes to local property values which will be examined and compared in our own data. The paper by Bradbury and co, details the large public costs of newly constructed professional sports stadiums compared to how little economic improvement they provide. This review on the stadiums and their impacts show the confounding ethical, public, and economic variables that we need to interpret to understand how professional sports stadiums impact localized economies.\n",

    "We predict that the presence of a professional sports stadium  will cause overall economic growth, specifically through an increase in total businesses and employment rates for the neighborhoods within a 2-mile radius of a stadium when compared to other neighborhoods within the same city, however this growth will be inversely correlated with property values in the same area. We predict that median housing prices within the 2 mile radius will grow at a lower rate than the city-wide average due to negative externalities from the stadium like pollution due to smog, construction, energy consumption, traffic congestion, and noise, all of which can have a stronger negative effect on property values more than the positive externalities from the stadium such as the business growth and infrastructure improvements. Neighborhoods a few miles away will see higher housing prices as people would want to live within range of the stadium to enjoy events, but also out of range to avoid the negative effects. "

    "1. Industry describes what sector the employer is in.\n",
    "2. Occupation describes what type of job the person performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an accountant working for a hospital is:\n",
    "- Industry: Healthcare\n",
    "- Occupation: Business/Financial operations \n",

    "This category typically includes:\n",
    "- Median household income (USD per year)\n",
    "- Per capita income (USD per year)\n",
    "- Mean earnings (USD per year)\n",
    "- Receipt of public assistance (%)\n",

    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "1. Important metrics: Latitude and longitude coordinates denote the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the stadium on Earth. They are composed of decimal degrees and, when put together, can pinpoint the exact location of a given sports stadium. These can be used to provide specific location information regarding the stadium that Python can parse through. This also helps clarify inaccurate team names that reflect a nearby major city or the name of the state rather than the physical location of the stadium.\n",
    "2. Major concerns: This dataset is from 2021 and may not reflect accurate team locations due to the movement of sports teams within the last 5 years. Additionally, its exhaustiveness (i.e., whether or not it includes all professional sports stadiums) has not been confirmed.\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
    "5. Feel free to add more cells here if that's helpful for you\n"

    "The most important metrics in the ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates dataset include total population, race and ethnicity composition, and total housing units. Total population is measured as an estimated count of individuals living in a given geographic area (such as a census tract, city, or state). For example, a census tract might have an estimated population of 4,200 people. These counts allow us to compare neighborhood size and calculate per-capita measures when analyzing economic outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race and ethnicity variables are also reported as counts and percentages, showing the share of residents identifying as White, Black or African American, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, and other categories. Changes in these percentages over time can signal demographic shifts such as migration, redevelopment, or possible displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total housing units is measued as a count of housing units in a specified area.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several major concerns with this dataset. First, because the ACS is survey based, estimates are subject to sampling error and potential nonresponse bias. Certain populations, such as undocumented residents or lower-income households may be undercounted. Second, smaller geographic units like census tracts often have larger margins of error, which can reduce confidence in precise comparisons. Finally, the dataset provides aggregated summary statistics rather than individual level data, meaning we cannot directly observe displacement or track specific residents over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionaly, demographic changes observed near stadiums may reflect broader citywide economic trends rather than the direct impact of the stadium itself, making careful statistical design necessary to avoid misleading conclusions that may be caused by other factors.\n",

    "### US Census Bureau: Selected Housing Characteristics (DP04)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 2024 5-Year Estimates. It provides a comprehensive profile of the housing stock, financial costs of homeownership and renting, and physical characteristics of housing units across specific geographies. The ACS is an ongoing survey that provides characteristics data, helping planners, researchers, and real estate analysts understand the quality of life and economic burden of housing in specific regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes several critical metrics for housing market analysis. Median Home Value and Median Gross Rent are provided in US Dollars, they represent the midpoint of all reported values, where half are higher and half are lower. A healthy housing market typically sees these values rising in line with local inflation, whereas stagnant or falling values may indicate economic decline. Housing Tenure (Owner vs. Renter occupied) is measured in raw counts and percentages, a high owner-occupancy rate suggests neighborhood stability, while high renter-occupancy can indicate a transient population or an area with high density multi-family development. Another important metric is Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income (GRAPI). The Census Bureau generally considers households spending 30% or more of their income on housing to be \"rent burdened,\" while those spending 50% or more are \"severely rent burdened,\" indicating a potential crisis in affordability.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major concern with this dataset is its reliance on self-reporting and sampling error. Because this is a survey of a sample of the population rather than a full count, every estimate comes with a Margin of Error (MOE). In smaller geographic areas (like specific census tracts near a stadium), the MOE can be quite large relative to the estimate, making the data less reliable. There is also a risk of Non-response Bias, when certain demographics, such as very high-income individuals or undocumented residents, may be less likely to respond to the survey accurately. Finally, \"Median Value\" is based on the respondent’s perception of what their home is worth, which may differ from actual market sale prices or tax appraisals.\n"

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All of our data is from the US Census and a Kaggle Dataset of Stadium locations. This means it is all collected through the informed consent of the individuals and public geographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Census Data can be biased, and certain individuals can sometimes fail to report sometimes. To mitigate this, we are taking our data over a course of 10+ years to judge median incomes and percentage increase, rather than raw income increases. This ensures that the bias will be mitigated due to differences in economic parity between cities and neighborhoods\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    ">This project minimizes exposure to personally identifiable information (PII) by exclusively using public, aggregated datasets that do not contain individual level records. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    ">Downstream bias is addressed by using aggregated Census demographic variables (e.g., race composition, housing tenure, income distribution) to examine whether observed neighborhood-level outcomes differ across demographic contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Since all datasets are public and non-PII, risk is minimal; nonetheless, standard safeguards such as access control and versioned backups are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Because the project uses only publicly available, aggregated data with no personal identifiers, individual data removal requests are not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Data will be retained only for the duration of the project and any required academic review period, after which local copies will be deleted. Public sources can be re-downloaded if replication is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We acknowledge that quantitative data may not capture lived experiences such as cultural displacement or housing insecurity. To address this, findings are contextualized using urban economics literature and prior case studies of stadium-led development, and assumptions are explicitly stated.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We explicitly examine known biases, including undercounting, survivorship bias due to displacement, and temporal smoothing in ACS data. We mitigate these through difference-in-differences analysis, sensitivity checks, and comparisons with control neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Visualizations and summary statistics are designed to avoid misleading interpretations. We present confidence intervals, margins of error where applicable, and avoid framing aggregate improvements as universal benefits without qualification.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    ">No PII is used or displayed in analysis outputs. All results are reported at an aggregated geographic level.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    ">The analysis workflow is fully documented and reproducible. Code, data sources, assumptions, and preprocessing steps are clearly recorded to enable auditing or revision if issues are discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    ">The project does not involve predictive models that make decisions about individuals. Demographic variables are used analytically to detect inequitable outcomes, not to allocate resources or make judgments about individuals or groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We explicitly compare outcomes across demographic subgroups (e.g., renter-heavy vs owner-heavy tracts) to assess whether stadium proximity is associated with uneven economic effects.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We avoid relying on a single metric (e.g., median income) and instead evaluate multiple indicators such as rent burden, housing values, employment, and business activity to reduce metric-induced bias.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - \n",
    ">All analytical methods (e.g., difference-in-differences) are explained in plain language, and results are interpretable without requiring advanced statistical background.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We clearly communicate limitations, including data bias, inability to observe displaced residents directly, and the non-causal nature of some findings. Conclusions are framed cautiously to avoid overgeneralization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">This project is an academic analysis and does not involve a deployed system or model requiring ongoing monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">As no automated decisions or services are deployed, formal redress mechanisms are not applicable. However, findings are presented responsibly to avoid harm through misinterpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    ">No production system or model is deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We acknowledge the risk that findings could be misused to justify harmful development practices. To mitigate this, results are contextualized ethically, emphasizing distributional impacts rather than framing stadium development as inherently beneficial or harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally:\n",
    "\n",
    "Longtime residents of these areas can be priced out of their homes and neighborhoods, especially as the price of housing increases, leading to gentrification around the stadium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stadiums can bring seasonal work, but not permanent employment, causing the surrounding area to see greater short term economic growth but realistically this employment structure is unstable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stadiums can affect the local environment, causing more pollution due to construction, traffic, energy consumption, etc. This pollution leads to the decreased quality of life around a stadium, causing people to move further away to still enjoy benefits without the drawbacks."
