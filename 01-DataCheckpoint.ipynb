    "Professional sports stadiums are often significantly large venues that host often profitable sporting events for the NFL, NBA, NHL, and other sporting leagues. Stadiums are also culturally significant as events like the Super Bowl, hosted in the Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana in 2025, had around 120 million viewers and around 76,000 filled seats.It can be assumed that stadiums  stimulate economic activity around the local area as businesses take advantage of the large foot traffic stadiums create, creating more jobs, increasing spending, tourism, and property value <sup>[2](#https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46552225_How_Does_a_New_Sports_Stadium_Affect_Housing_Values_The_Case_of_Fedex_Field)</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, studies and articles conclude that the construction of new stadiums yields negligible improvements to local employment<sup>[3](#https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22534)</sup>, and may take spending away from local businesses as people spend it on stadium related costs instead. Additionally, stadium construction is often funded by public subsidies that can be used on other local construction projects or programs. While stadiums may generate a localized economic surge within their immediate vicinity<sup>[1](#https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/NAR.2024024?viewType=HTML)</sup> and foster civic identity and pride, analysts argue their regional economic impact is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we are observing how professional sports stadiums affect the local economy. In a 2024 research paper, Antolini Valerio analyzes trends in GDP per capita in Turin, Italy around the construction of a new and technologically impressive NFL stadium called a next-generation stadium. The writer found a causal relationship between an increase in GDP per capita with the new stadium compared to other regions of Italy that showed comparatively lower growths in GDP per capita1. The paper provides some insights on how new and expensive stadiums can change local economic production. In a study by Charles Tu, the construction of a stadium causes homes to be sold at a lower price, but over longer periods of time land value increases. The study shows that there are changes to local property values which will be examined and compared in our own data. The paper by Bradbury and co, details the large public costs of newly constructed professional sports stadiums compared to how little economic improvement they provide. This review on the stadiums and their impacts show the confounding ethical, public, and economic variables that we need to interpret to understand how professional sports stadiums impact localized economies.\n",

    "We predict that the presence of a professional sports stadium  will cause overall economic growth, specifically through an increase in total businesses and employment rates for the neighborhoods within a 2-mile radius of a stadium when compared to other neighborhoods within the same city, however this growth will be inversely correlated with property values in the same area. We predict that median housing prices within the 2 mile radius will grow at a lower rate than the city-wide average due to negative externalities from the stadium like pollution due to smog, construction, energy consumption, traffic congestion, and noise, all of which can have a stronger negative effect on property values more than the positive externalities from the stadium such as the business growth and infrastructure improvements. Neighborhoods a few miles away will see higher housing prices as people would want to live within range of the stadium to enjoy events, but also out of range to avoid the negative effects. "

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

To mitigate this, we are taking our data over a course of 10+ years to judge median incomes and percentage increase, rather than raw income increases. This ensures that the bias will be mitigated due to differences in economic parity between cities and neighborhoods\n",

    ">We explicitly compare outcomes across demographic subgroups (e.g., renter-heavy vs owner-heavy tracts) to assess whether stadium proximity is associated with uneven economic effects.\n",

    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We avoid relying on a single metric (e.g., median income) and instead evaluate multiple indicators such as rent burden, housing values, employment, and business activity to reduce metric-induced bias.\n",

    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",

    "Longtime residents of these areas can be priced out of their homes and neighborhoods, especially as the price of housing increases, leading to gentrification around the stadium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stadiums can bring seasonal work, but not permanent employment, causing the surrounding area to see greater short term economic growth but realistically this employment structure is unstable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stadiums can affect the local environment, causing more pollution due to construction, traffic, energy consumption, etc. This pollution leads to the decreased quality of life around a stadium, causing people to move further away to still enjoy benefits without the drawbacks."

    "* *Do your fair share of work. We are all adults, and we know whether we are doing enough work to be considered good teammates. This is a social contract that we all need to uphold if we want to succeed.*"
